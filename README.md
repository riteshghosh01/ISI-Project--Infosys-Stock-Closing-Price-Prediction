# ISI-Project--Infosys-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction
This project investigates the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for the task of forecasting the closing prices of INFOSYS (NSE: INFY) stock, leveraging historical time-series financial data. A foundational model was developed using the SimpleRNN layer from the TensorFlow/Keras library, trained on daily closing price data spanning from June 1, 2020, to May 31, 2025. The model is structured to use a rolling window of the previous 60 trading days to predict the subsequent day's closing price. To ensure that the predictions are generated for valid trading dates, user input is strictly validated against NSE trading holidays, weekends, and a predefined historical range.

To assess the efficacy of deep learning methods, the base RNN model's performance is compared against a conventional baseline — a Linear Regression model trained on the same dataset. Furthermore, the project explores deeper architectures by integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is known for its superior capability in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.

The study is extended through the implementation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques for fine-tuning the base RNN model. This hybrid RNN-RL framework is designed to improve predictive performance by learning long-term reward-driven behaviors, thus addressing common challenges in financial time-series forecasting such as non-stationarity, high volatility, and noisy trends. The RL-enhanced models aim to optimize not just pointwise prediction accuracy but also sequence-level consistency across multiple forecast steps.

The system includes dynamic visualization tools for plotting historical trends alongside predicted values, and allows for real-time comparison between predicted and actual stock prices when available. Validation metrics such as MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE and R² score are computed to quantify model accuracy and assess generalization. This work demonstrates the practical feasibility of using RNN-based architectures for financial forecasting, highlights the limitations of shallow sequence models, and shows the measurable improvements possible through reinforcement learning strategies. It contributes to ongoing research in algorithmic finance, offering insights into the role of hybrid deep learning models in tackling real-world market prediction tasks.
